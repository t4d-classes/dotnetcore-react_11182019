Exercise 6

1. Move the list of colors to its own component. Think about how you could make very reusable.

2. Update the Color Form component to use the useForm hook we created at the end of yesterday.

3. Move the Car Form to its own component. If the Car Form is not using the useForm hook, please update it to do so.

4. Ensure it works. Bon chance!
